Among various AD frameworks, Autograd, Autodiff, and Enzyme were benchmarked over Stillinger-Weber potential of Si atoms. Stillinger-Weber was chosen as most benchmarks and frameworks focus on traditional linear algebra kind problems, where as I am more interested on ML applications on more scientific problems. All the code would be uploaded in github soon. Presentation can be downloaded <a href="https://1drv.ms/b/s!Ave1F6LmCN-jg7l-XVDYJgHCQiQC2A">here</a>.
